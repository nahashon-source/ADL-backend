# CVE-2024-23342 - python-ecdsa: Minerva timing attack vulnerability
# Severity: HIGH
# Package: ecdsa 0.19.1
# Status: No fix available as of 2025-10-07
# 
# Justification for acceptance:
# - No patch available from package maintainers

# - Risk accepted pending availability of security patch
# 
# Mitigation:
# - Using python-jose 3.4.0 which includes other security fixes
# - Monitoring for ecdsa package updates
# - Will upgrade immediately when fix is released
